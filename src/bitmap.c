This function creates a new QuantumCircuit object with a specified number of qubits.

This function adds a gate to a quantum circuit. It first checks for errors such as a null circuit pointer, 
an invalid qubit index, or a gate type that is not supported. If the gate is a single qubit or measurement gate, 
it adds the gate to the circuit's list of gates. If it is a two-qubit gate, it checks that the circuit has at 
least two qubits and then adds the gate to two consecutive qubits in the circuit's gate list.

This function deallocates the memory allocated to a QuantumCircuit struct, including any 
dynamically allocated memory inside its qubitStates and gates arrays. It first checks 
if the circuit pointer is NULL, and returns early if it is. It then frees the qubitStates

Finally, it frees the QuantumCircuit struct itself and sets its pointer to NULL.

it toggles the qubit state and records the gate operation in the circuit. Finally, it returns the updated qubit state.
